							<h2>SaaS Retention Pro - A Customer Retention Dashboard</h2>
							
							<h3>Scope of the Project</h3>
							<p>
								The SaaS Retention Pro dashboard was developed to tackle the pressing issue of customer churn in a subscription-based SaaS platform for small-to-medium businesses (SMBs). The project aimed to provide customer success teams with a centralized tool that delivered real-time churn predictions, customer health scores, and engagement analytics. By integrating predictive models and actionable insights into the existing platform, the solution sought to enable proactive retention strategies, reduce manual efforts, and enhance customer satisfaction.
							</p>
				
							<h3>The Challenge</h3>
							<p>
								Customer churn posed a significant challenge for the platform, particularly among SMB customers who often struggled with budget constraints and resource limitations. Existing retention efforts relied heavily on reactive measures, such as contacting churned accounts or manually consolidating fragmented data from various tools, which were both time-intensive and ineffective. The lack of predictive capabilities further exacerbated the issue, leaving teams unable to identify or address churn risks before they materialized.
							</p>
				
							<h3>Phase 1: Discovery and Problem Definition</h3>
							<img src="images/img.png" style="max-width: 100%;">

							<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand the root causes of customer churn and align with business objectives.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Stakeholder Engagement: Conducted meetings with key stakeholders (customer success, sales, marketing, and executives) to understand their pain points, priorities, and goals for improving retention.
									<p>○ Outcome: Identified churn as a top priority metric impacting revenue.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Data Analysis: Worked with data analysts to review customer churn metrics, segment user behavior, and identify trends. Key metrics analyzed included churn rate, customer lifetime value (CLV), and Net Promoter Score (NPS).
									<p>○ Outcome: Discovered that churn was highest among small-to-medium business (SMB) clients after the first 3 months.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Customer Feedback: Conducted interviews and surveys with recently churned and retained customers to understand dissatisfaction drivers and feature gaps.
									<p>○ Outcome: Identified a need for proactive, data-driven insights to help customers derive more value from the platform.</p>
								</li>

							</ol>
							<h3>Phase 2: Ideation and Roadmap Development</h3>
							<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Define the solution, align the team, and plan the execution.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Feature Ideation: Collaborated with cross-functional teams (engineering, data science, and UX/UI design) to brainstorm features for a retention dashboard. Key proposed features included:
									<p>○ Real-time churn prediction based on usage patterns.<br>
									○ Alerts for at-risk customers.<br>
									○ Metrics such as engagement scores and renewal probability.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Prioritization: Used frameworks like RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize features that would have the most significant impact on reducing churn.
									<p>○ Outcome: Focused on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with predictive churn metrics and customer engagement alerts.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Roadmap Creation: Developed a detailed roadmap with timelines, deliverables, and milestones for each phase of the dashboard's development.
									<p>○ Outcome: Gained buy-in from stakeholders on the roadmap and set clear expectations for delivery.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Phase 3: Design and Prototyping</h3>
							<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create a user-friendly design that aligns with customer needs and business goals.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Wireframing: Created low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to visualize the layout and flow of the dashboard.
									<p>○ Included sections for:<br>
									■ A customer health scorecard.<br>
									■ Key engagement metrics.<br>
									■ Alerts and recommended actions for at-risk customers.</p>
								</li>
								<li>User Journey Mapping: Designed customer journeys to ensure that the dashboard seamlessly integrated into the workflows of customer success managers and sales teams.
									<p>○ Outcome: Validated that the dashboard would streamline processes rather than add complexity.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Prototyping: Developed a high-fidelity interactive prototype, incorporating feedback from internal teams to refine the design.
									<p>○ Outcome: Finalized a prototype ready for development.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<img src="images/prototype.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
							<h3>Phase 4: Development and Integration</h3>
							<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build and integrate the dashboard into the SaaS platform.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Model Development: Partnered with data science teams to build a machine learning model that predicted churn based on historical data and behavioral trends.
									<p>○ Features included:<br>
									■ Usage frequency.<br>
									■ Feature adoption rates.<br>
									■ Customer support interactions.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Engineering Collaboration: Worked with the engineering team to integrate the churn prediction model and dashboard into the SaaS platform. APIs were developed to fetch real-time data and populate the dashboard.
									<p>○ Outcome: Ensured a scalable and reliable solution by conducting regular check-ins and sprint reviews.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Agile Sprints: Followed Agile methodologies, breaking down development into two-week sprints with clearly defined deliverables.
									<p>○ Outcome: Delivered an MVP within the planned timeline.</p>
								</li>
